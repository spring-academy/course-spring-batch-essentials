You've built a production-ready, fault-tolerant batch job with Spring Batch and Spring Boot!

## Accomplishments

Throughout this course, you've learned a lot of things about Spring Batch. Let's review your accomplishments:

- You've gotten a good understanding of the main concepts in Spring Batch like jobs, job instances, job executions, etc.
- You've learned how to structure your jobs with steps.
- You've also learned _and used_ the main APIs to read, process and write data.
- You've seen how Spring Batch manages the state of job executions, and how it uses that state to restart failed jobs where they left off.
- You've implemented fault-tolerant features like Retry and Skip.
- You've learned how to test your jobs.
- By using Spring Boot, you've learned how to boost your batch application development, thanks to Spring Boot autoconfiguration features.

## Keep Learning

While this course is a good introduction to Spring Batch, there is still more you can learn! Topics like observability, concurrency, scalability and others were not addressed in this course. We encourage you to check the reference documentation and other resources in the [main page of the project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch).
