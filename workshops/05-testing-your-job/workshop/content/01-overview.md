In the previous lesson, we discussed the various test utilities provided by Spring Batch to simplify testing batch artifacts. In this Lab, we will use some of these utilities to improve our `BillingJob` test. Those utilities are provided in the `spring-batch-test` module, which is already imported as a test dependency in the `pom.xml` file, so we are ready to start using those utilities in our test.

Moreover, as with previous Labs, this Lab is initialized with a fresh instance of PostgreSQL running in a Docker container that we will use for tests.
