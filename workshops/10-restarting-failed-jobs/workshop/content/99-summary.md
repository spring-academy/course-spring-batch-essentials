In this Lab, you learned how to restart a failed job instance until it succeeds. You also learned how Spring Batch achieves that by understanding how it manages the state of execution and how it uses that state to restart failed jobs and steps where they left off.

Now, what if we want to skip those bad lines for further analysis instead of letting the job fail? This is what we will see in the next lesson and Lab.
