`input/billing-2023-03.csv` contains the billing data for March 2023. This file contains 500 lines of billing data, similar to previous files.

Feel free to open this file in the Editor and inspect it.

```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/input/billing-2023-03.csv
description: "Open billing-2023-03.csv"
```

Let's run our billing job to process this file and generate March's billing report.

1. Build the project.

   Open a **Terminal** and run the following command to build the project:

   ```dashboard:open-dashboard
   name: Terminal
   ```

   ```shell
   [~/exercises] $ ./mvnw clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
   ```

1. Run the job.

   Next, launch the `BillingJob` with the following parameters to process `billing-2023-03.csv`:

   ```dashboard:open-dashboard
   name: Terminal
   ```

   ```shell
   [~/exercises] $ java -jar target/billing-job-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar input.file=input/billing-2023-03.csv output.file=staging/billing-report-2023-03.csv data.year=2023 data.month=3
   ```

   You should see the following status of the process in the output:

   ```shell
   INFO 1586 --- [           main] o.s.b.c.l.support.SimpleJobLauncher      : Job: [SimpleJob: [name=BillingJob]] completed with the following parameters: [{'data.year':'{value=2023, type=class java.lang.String, identifying=true}','output.file':'{value=staging/billing-report-2023-03.csv, type=class java.lang.String, identifying=true}','data.month':'{value=3, type=class java.lang.String, identifying=true}','input.file':'{value=input/billing-2023-03.csv, type=class java.lang.String, identifying=true}'}] and the following status: [FAILED] in 148ms
   ```

   The job failed! Let's find out why.

1. Analyze the failure.

   Let's inspect the error's stack trace:

   ```dashboard:open-dashboard
   name: Terminal
   ```

   ```shell
   org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileParseException: Parsing error at line: 226 in resource=[file [/home/eduk8s/exercises/input/billing-2023-03.csv]], input=[2023,03,325,404-555-1225,92-94,375,544]
   ...
   Caused by: org.springframework.beans.TypeMismatchException: Failed to convert value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'float'; For input string: "92-94"
   ...
   Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "92-94"
   ```

   It seems that the item reader is not able to parse line 226, which contains an invalid value for the `data usage` field.

   Open `input/billing-2023-03.csv` and inspect line 226:

   ```editor:open-file
   file: ~/exercises/input/billing-2023-03.csv
   line: 226
   description: "Open billing-2023-03.csv at line 226"
   ```

   ```csv
   2023,03,325,404-555-1225,92-94,375,544
   ```

Indeed, the value `92-94` which corresponds to the `data usage` field is expected to be numerical, but it is not.

Let's fix that!
