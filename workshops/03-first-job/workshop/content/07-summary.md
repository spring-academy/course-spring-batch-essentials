Congratulations! You have successfully created your first Spring Batch job with an application based on Spring Boot.

In this Lab, the content was carefully designed so you implement the `Job` interface directly for learning purposes.

You will almost never have to implement that interface directly, as Spring Batch provides ready-to-use implementations like `SimpleJob` for simple sequential step-based jobs and `FlowJob` for jobs which requires a complex step execution flows.

In the next module, you will use these classes and learn how to structure the workflow of your batch job with steps.
