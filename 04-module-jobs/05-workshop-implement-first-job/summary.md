Congratulations! You've successfully created your first Spring Batch job with an application based on Spring Boot.

In this Lab, the content was carefully designed so that you'd implement the `Job` interface directly, for learning purposes.
You'll almost never have to implement that interface directly, as Spring Batch provides ready-to-use implementations like `SimpleJob` for simple sequential step-based jobs, and `FlowJob` for jobs which require complex step execution flows.

In the next module, you'll use these classes, and learn how to structure the workflow of your batch job with steps.
